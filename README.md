# Daedalus
Minecraft AntiCheat Plugin!

Description
Daedalus anti-cheat is an advanced anti-cheat and has very lightweight methods to ensure minimal lag for your network. It is optimized for HCF, Practice, and other PvP related game-modes! Alerts give specific information on the player which no other anti-cheat gives. Normally, other anti-cheats give that information in a sloppy, ugly way. That's different with Daedalus! Daedalus gives it in a minimalistic manner, leaving your staff at ease!
